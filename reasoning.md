# Reasoning & Design Choices

## Why this wording
- The prompt sets an explicit role and clear constraints (help debug, do not give the full solution). This prevents the assistant from accidentally returning finished code.
- A staged structure (Clarify → Diagnose → Tiered Hints → Actionable Steps) gives a repeatable, teachable flow that works well across many bug types and learner levels.

## How it sidesteps giving the solution
- **Explicit refusal:** The prompt instructs the assistant to refuse full, working implementations on request.  
- **Graduated hints:** The tiered hint system forces progressive disclosure (high-level → targeted → micro), which reduces the risk of handing over a fix prematurely.  
- **Encourages testing:** The assistant is asked to recommend prints/asserts and small tests rather than paste fixes, which promotes verification instead of copy-pasting.

## How it fosters student-friendly, helpful feedback
- **Socratic & encouraging tone:** Guides students with questions and nudges rather than lecturing.  
- **Actionable debugging steps:** Concrete suggestions (print values, assert invariants, run small test cases, use `pdb`) that students can perform immediately.  
- **Concept-first explanations:** Short conceptual clarifications (1–2 sentences) that explain *why* the bug happens so students learn, not just fix.

# Required Reasoning Answers

## 1. Tone & style
- **Tone:** Friendly, patient, encouraging.  
- **Style:** Socratic and concise — ask short, guiding questions and present numbered, stepwise hints. Use bullets and short paragraphs for readability.

## 2. Balance: identifying bugs vs guiding the student
- **Quick diagnosis:** Start with a brief (1–2 bullet) hypothesis list of the most likely bug classes.  
- **Guided discovery:** Use the 3-level hint escalation — begin with high-level cues so students attempt fixes themselves; only narrow to targeted hints if they request more help.  
- **Minimize hand-holding:** Provide tests and inspection commands to confirm hypotheses rather than providing final code.

## 3. How to adapt for beginners vs advanced learners
- **Beginners:** Use simpler language, break steps into very small tasks (e.g., exactly where to insert `print()`), show short examples of the debugging action (not the fix), and explain basic language behavior (zero-based indexing, mutability).  
- **Advanced:** Be terse, focus on invariants and edge cases, mention profiling and complexity concerns, suggest advanced tools (profilers, `pytest`, `pdb` usage patterns), and link to relevant docs when helpful.

# Quick practical guidance (concise)

## Likely bug types (lead with these ASAP — 1–2 bullets)
- Off-by-one / indexing errors and wrong assumptions about input shapes or empty inputs.  
- Type mismatches, mutable default arguments, and logic/branching mistakes.

## 3-level hint escalation (how to lead)
1. **High-level (always first):** Point to the general concept to check (e.g., indexing, input validation, off-by-one).  
2. **Targeted (if student asks for more):** Point to a specific function, loop, or variable and suggest what to print/inspect (no corrected code).  
3. **Micro-hint (only on request):** Give a tiny pseudocode nudge or indicate a boundary change (e.g., “adjust start by ±1”) while still withholding a full solution.

## Always include actionable tests to confirm hypotheses
- Ask the student to run 2–3 quick checks, for example:
  - Print `len(...)`, types (`type(x)`), and `repr(x)` before the failing line.
  - Test the function with edge cases: `[]`, `[single]`, and a larger list.
  - Add `assert` statements for key invariants (e.g., `assert len(arr) > 0`).

# Practical checklist to include in each assistant response
- 1–2 sentence summary of goal + observed mistake.  
- 1–2 likely causes (bulleted).  
- Tiered hints starting at high-level.  
- 2 actionable debug steps to run now.  
- 1–2 sentence concept explanation.  
- 1–3 item next-steps checklist and invitation to paste outputs.
